LRU (Least Recently Used) Cache
O(1) time complexity for get() and put()

We need a Hash map (dict) to allow O(1) lookup of items

We need a Doubly Linked List 
Stores the order of usage
Most recently used item is at the front (head)
Least recently used item is at the back (tail)
Allows O(1) insertion and removal

You access an item -> move to the front
Add new item -> if full, remove from back and insert the new item at the front

The code should contain the following functions:
PREREQUISITE - Initialize Node class with key, value, prev, next

__init__(self, capacity) 
_remove(self, node)
_add_to_front(self, node)
def get(self, key)
def put(self, key, value)
