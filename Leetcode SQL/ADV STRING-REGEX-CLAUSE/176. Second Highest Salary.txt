Write a solution to find the second highest distinct salary from the Employee table. If there is no second highest salary, return null (return None in Pandas).

The result format is in the following example.

Example 1:

Input: 
Employee table:
+----+--------+
| id | salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+
Output: 
+---------------------+
| SecondHighestSalary |
+---------------------+
| 200                 |
+---------------------+


Solution:

Select the max salary that is lesser than the max salary
Returns null if it does not exist

SELECT max(salary) as SecondHighestSalary 
FROM employee
WHERE employee.salary < (
SELECT max(salary)
FROM employee
)


Alternate solution:

SELECT
    COALESCE(T1.salary, NULL) AS SecondHighestSalary
FROM
    (SELECT 1) AS dummy  -- Creates one row to LEFT JOIN against
LEFT JOIN
    (
        SELECT DISTINCT salary
        FROM employee
        ORDER BY salary DESC -- Ordering is crucial for 'OFFSET' to mean 'N-th highest'
        LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1
    ) AS T1 ON 1=1;
