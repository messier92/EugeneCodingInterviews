You are the restaurant owner and you want to analyze a possible expansion (there will be at least one customer every day).
Compute the moving average of how much the customer paid in a seven days window (i.e., current day + 6 days before). average_amount should be rounded to two decimal places.
Return the result table ordered by visited_on in ascending order.
The result format is in the following example.

Example 1:

Input: 
Customer table:
+-------------+--------------+--------------+-------------+
| customer_id | name         | visited_on   | amount      |
+-------------+--------------+--------------+-------------+
| 1           | Jhon         | 2019-01-01   | 100         |
| 2           | Daniel       | 2019-01-02   | 110         |
| 3           | Jade         | 2019-01-03   | 120         |
| 4           | Khaled       | 2019-01-04   | 130         |
| 5           | Winston      | 2019-01-05   | 110         | 
| 6           | Elvis        | 2019-01-06   | 140         | 
| 7           | Anna         | 2019-01-07   | 150         |
| 8           | Maria        | 2019-01-08   | 80          |
| 9           | Jaze         | 2019-01-09   | 110         | 
| 1           | Jhon         | 2019-01-10   | 130         | 
| 3           | Jade         | 2019-01-10   | 150         | 
+-------------+--------------+--------------+-------------+
Output: 
+--------------+--------------+----------------+
| visited_on   | amount       | average_amount |
+--------------+--------------+----------------+
| 2019-01-07   | 860          | 122.86         |
| 2019-01-08   | 840          | 120            |
| 2019-01-09   | 840          | 120            |
| 2019-01-10   | 1000         | 142.86         |
+--------------+--------------+----------------+

Solution:
Self join

SELECT a.visited_on, SUM(amount) AS amount,
ROUND((SUM(amount)/7),2) AS average_amount
FROM
(SELECT DISTINCT visited_on FROM Customer) a JOIN Customer 
ON DATEDIFF(a.visited_on, b.visited_on) BETWEEN 0 AND 6
GROUP BY a.visited_on
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT b.visited_on) = 7
ORDER BY a.visited_on
