A single number is a number that appeared only once in the MyNumbers table.
Find the largest single number. If there is no single number, report null.
The result format is in the following example.

Example 1:

Input: 
MyNumbers table:
+-----+
| num |
+-----+
| 8   |
| 8   |
| 3   |
| 3   |
| 1   |
| 4   |
| 5   |
| 6   |
+-----+
Output: 
+-----+
| num |
+-----+
| 6   |
+-----+

Solution:
1. Count the numbers that only appears once as a CTE
2. Get the max of the subquery

# Write your MySQL query statement below
With GroupedNumbers AS (
    SELECT m.num 
    FROM MyNumbers m
    GROUP BY m.num
    HAVING COUNT(m.num) <= 1
) 
SELECT max(num) AS num
FROM GroupedNumbers
