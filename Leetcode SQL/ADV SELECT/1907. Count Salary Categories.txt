Write a solution to calculate the number of bank accounts for each salary category. The salary categories are:

"Low Salary": All the salaries strictly less than $20000.
"Average Salary": All the salaries in the inclusive range [$20000, $50000].
"High Salary": All the salaries strictly greater than $50000.
The result table must contain all three categories. If there are no accounts in a category, return 0.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

Solution:

# Write your MySQL query statement below
WITH cte_1 AS (
    SELECT income FROM 
    accounts WHERE 
    income < 20000
),
cte_2 AS (
    SELECT income FROM 
    accounts WHERE 
    income >= 20000 and income <= 50000
),
cte_3 AS (
    SELECT income FROM 
    accounts WHERE 
    income > 50000 
)

SELECT 'Low Salary' as category, count(*) as accounts_count from cte_1 
UNION
SELECT 'Average Salary' as category, count(*) as accounts_count from cte_2
UNION
SELECT 'High Salary' as category, count(*) as accounts_count from cte_3
