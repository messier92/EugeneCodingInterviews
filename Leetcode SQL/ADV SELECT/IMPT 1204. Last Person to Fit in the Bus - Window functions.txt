There is a queue of people waiting to board a bus. However, the bus has a weight limit of 1000 kilograms, so there may be some people who cannot board.

Write a solution to find the person_name of the last person that can fit on the bus without exceeding the weight limit. The test cases are generated such that the first person does not exceed the weight limit.

Note that only one person can board the bus at any given turn.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Queue table:
+-----------+-------------+--------+------+
| person_id | person_name | weight | turn |
+-----------+-------------+--------+------+
| 5         | Alice       | 250    | 1    |
| 4         | Bob         | 175    | 5    |
| 3         | Alex        | 350    | 2    |
| 6         | John Cena   | 400    | 3    |
| 1         | Winston     | 500    | 6    |
| 2         | Marie       | 200    | 4    |
+-----------+-------------+--------+------+
Output: 
+-------------+
| person_name |
+-------------+
| John Cena   |
+-------------+

Solution:

# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT
    person_name
FROM
    (
        -- 1. Calculate the running total weight for each person in boarding order
        SELECT
            person_name,
            weight,
            turn,
            -- Calculate the cumulative weight as people board the bus, ordered by 'turn'
            SUM(weight) OVER (ORDER BY turn) AS cumulative_weight
        FROM
            Queue
    ) AS CumulativeQueue
-- 2. Filter out all people whose cumulative weight exceeds the limit (1000 kg)
WHERE
    cumulative_weight <= 1000
-- 3. Select the last person who meets the criteria
ORDER BY
    turn DESC -- Order the remaining list in reverse (highest turn first)
LIMIT 1; -- Take only the first row (the person with the highest valid 'turn')
