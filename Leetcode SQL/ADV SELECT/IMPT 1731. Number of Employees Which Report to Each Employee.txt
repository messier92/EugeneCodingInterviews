For this problem, we will consider a manager an employee who has at least 1 other employee reporting to them.
Write a solution to report the ids and the names of all managers, the number of employees who report directly to them, and the average age of the reports rounded to the nearest integer.
Return the result table ordered by employee_id.

Solution:

# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT tbl_a.employee_id, tbl_a.name, tbl_b.report_count as reports_count,ROUND(tbl_b.average_age) AS average_age 
FROM employees as tbl_a
JOIN (
    SELECT reports_to, COUNT(*) AS report_count, AVG(age) as average_age
    FROM employees
    WHERE reports_to IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY reports_to
) tbl_b ON tbl_a.employee_id = tbl_b.reports_to
ORDER BY tbl_a.employee_id;
